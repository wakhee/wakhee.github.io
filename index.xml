      <description>Just to make things clear: I believe that democracy is indeed the right form of government in many countries at the present. But at the same time I feel we need to discuss some of it&amp;rsquo;s de-merits and undetstand it&amp;rsquo;s limitations so that we can create a governemt that better serves the public.</description>

      <description>I was tired of just consuming content and not creating anything that was my own, original and personal. Youtube was an option, but I felt that the barrier of entry was pretty high, with all the requirments like good microphone, lighting, etc. to create decent content. The bigger issue was that I felt the video format was not suitable to constantly update and ideas and was not the most accessible even.</description>
